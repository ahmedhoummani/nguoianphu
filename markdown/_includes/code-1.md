You can format code in markdown too. For inline code, wrap code in backticks `like this`. For multi-line code blocks, wrap code in three backticks. Make sure to separate the block from other paragraphs/lists using a blank line.

If you're going to use Markdown on [GitHub](http://github.com) or related sites, read about GitHub Flavored Markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).
<!--break-->Usage: `hello("chibicode")`

def hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
```
