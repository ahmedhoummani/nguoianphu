You can't change font sizes in markdown, but you can create headings.

Begin a line with one or more of `#` to create a heading. The number of `#` corresponds to the heading level. You can specify up to 6 levels of headings.
<!--break--># Heading Level 1

### Heading Level 3

This is a paragraph.

#### Heading Level 4

###### Heading Level 6
